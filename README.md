# brick-breaker

###Project: A self-pace side project learnt by watching tutorials. The end product is a brick breaker game, similar to a traditional one found at arcades.

##Task: Create a Java project simulation of the brick breaker game. The objective is for the program to be user-friendly, engaging and bug-free.

##Criteria: You are to produce a program that outputs the following:
- There is a ball that bounces off of an automated moving board
- The board is to be controlled by the user by pressing on their arrow keys
- the ball is to hit blocks/bricks closer to the top of the screen
- each time the ball hits a brick, the score is to increase by five points
- If the user were to miss the ball, the game is over, total points are displayed to the user and an option to play again should follow as well
- If the user were to win, a congratulations message should appear followed by the option to restart the game over game

##Summary of Tech Stack: The program was coded using the Java programming language. The IDE which was utilized to produce and house the code was the eclipse IDE.

##Functionality: The program functions as noted in the intended criteria. There is an automated ball that moves across the user's screen and bounces off of the sliding board, walls and bricks. The program serves its purpose entirely.  

##Design: The graphic representation of the game is slightly different from the original game. The colour scheme matches the developer's range of favourite colours, thus various shades of blue. The background is one shade of blue, the ball is another and the board is a third. That is the main difference, otherwise, the game performs as it is expected.
