# brick-breaker

###Project: A self-pace side project learnt by watching tutorials. The end product is a brick breaker game, similar to a traditional one found at arcades.

##Task: Create a Java project simulation of the brick breaker game. The objective is for the program to be user-friendly, engaging and bug free.

##Criteria: You are to produce a program that outputs the following:
- There is a ball that bounces off of a automated moving board
- The board is to be controlled by the user by pressing on their arrow keys
- the ball is to hit blocks/bricks closer to the top of the screen
- each time the ball hits a brick, the score is to increase by five points
- If the user were to miss the ball, the game is over, total points are dispalayed to the user and an option to play again should follow as well
- If the user were to win, a congratuations message should appear followed by the option to restart the game over game
